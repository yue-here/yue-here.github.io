Generative text-to-image models have recent become very popular. Having a bunch of leftover data from the [This JACS Does Not Exist](http://thisjacsdoesnotexist.com/) project, I've trained a Stable Diffusion checkpoint on the ~60K JACS table-of-contents images with paper titles as the captions. Here are some examples with the prompt in the caption:
