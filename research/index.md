# Research

Broadly: materials science, applications of machine learning, autonomous experimentation

Projects I've worked on previously:

* A new method for [intelligent exploration of design spaces](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01326-2) beyond Bayesian optimization. With Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX), any design space exploration question can easily be optimized, e.g.: "find synthesis conditions for nanoparticles with dispersity <5% and sizes of {10, 20, 30} Â± 0.5nm".

* Invented a way to [make covalent organic frameworks ('COFs') in water, in minutes, using ultrasound](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44160-021-00005-0). Usually they are made in toxic organic solvents over 3 days in an oven at 120 &deg;C.

* Created a method to [3D print pure metal-organic framework ('MOF') monoliths without binder](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.9b00069) by extruding a colloidal gel of MOF nanoparticles.

* Discovered a new family of [hypophosphite-based hybrid perovskites](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b09417)

* Used _in situ_ X-ray diffraction to [understand the formation processes of MOFs](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201608463).

* Reported the first [full characterisation of negative thermal expansion in MOFs](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.200803925).
